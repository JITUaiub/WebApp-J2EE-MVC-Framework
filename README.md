# WebApp-MVC-Framework
A simple java framework api, which provides features like -
1. Controller - simply make a Controller class
2. Model - Model class implementation with Model interface
3. Views - will be according to controller.

Simple Mappings of the web application will be in WebAppMVC-mappings.xml
And place WebAppMVC_v1.0.jar to your web application/WEB-INF/lib folder.

Documentation is also there for WebAppMVC framework.

Thanks from me, and feel free to contribute to this framework.
